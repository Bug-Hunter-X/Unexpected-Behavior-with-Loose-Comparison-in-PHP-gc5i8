This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP involving loose comparison. The script `bug.php` shows an example where comparing values of different types (0 and "0") with loose comparison (`==`) leads to an unexpected result.  The solution, `bugSolution.php`, demonstrates how to use strict comparison (`===`) to avoid this issue and ensure accurate comparisons.  This is important for preventing unexpected behavior and ensuring the correctness of your code.
